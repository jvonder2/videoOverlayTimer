Fun little program I wrote that allows you to listen to music with a timer and a pretty overlay

Bascially the program allows you to input an amount of time the timer goes for and a youtube video, and will play the audio of the youtube video along with a progress bar for the timer as an overlay for your computer so you can study to music with a nice timer

Lots of updates to be added to this program that could make it significantly better because right now its very barebones and I wrote it in about a day
Potential updates:
1. Add an original and better pixel art image and maybe make it a GIF for more comfortable experience
2. Make the progress bar swapable with a timer so you can have a timer or progress bar whichever you choose
3. Currently if the video ends it is just empty noise so for now an easy fix that I will make is have it repeat the video but eventually if I really commit to it, I'll make it so you can add mulitple songs to the list
4. Make alarm at the end of the timer (idk how to do this but i can prolly figure it out)
5. Someone who tested it says they might want to hide timer fully but keep it running so maybe I'll do that for him <3 robert 
6. Definitely more QOL updates to be make so I'm just gonna add this line because its 3am and I have more to add but idk what yet
